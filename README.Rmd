title: "Shiny application project outline"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a rough attempt to formalize an outline for documenting a shiny application. 

## Motivation

I noticed after creating a shiny application, I had a hard time keeping track of `ui.R` and `server.R` components using `#comments`, so I created a parent folder and R project (.Rproj), then started a `README.Rmd` file to document the contents in each file.  

```
|-- shiny-project > *this is the parent folder file*
    |-- App 
    |   |-- App.Rproj
    |   |-- data
    |   |   |-- 2019-02-20.RData
    |   |   |-- data-file-01.csv
    |   |   |-- data-file-02.csv
    |   |   |-- data-file-03.csv
    |   |-- helpers.R
    |   |-- server.R
    |   |-- ui.R
    |   |-- www
    |       |-- picture-01.jpg
    |       |-- logo-02.jpg
    |       |-- style.css
    |-- README.Rmd -> *this is the documentation file*
    |-- README.md
    |-- data -> *data files for the app are also stored here*
    |   |-- 2019-02-20.RData
        |-- data-file-01.csv
        |-- data-file-02.csv
        |-- data-file-03.csv
    |-- images -> *image files for the app*
    |   |-- picture-01.jpg
    |   |-- logo-02.jpg
    |   |-- style.css
    |-- shiny-project-appndx-a.Rmd -> *appendix for additional descriptions*
    |-- shiny-project.Rproj
    |-- rsconnect
        |-- documents
            |-- App
            |   |-- shinyapps.io
```

This is really the beginning of an idea, and I have only implemented it on a few projects (see example [here](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/seg-shiny-v-1-3-1/)).

I would love feedback from anyone!
